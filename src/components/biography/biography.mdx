Started my software engineering journey in 2009 and have been working in the industry in various contexts and roles.
The focus has always been on learning domains and technologies as I come across them.

I'm a originally from India and currently living in Germany. Pushing code since 2015,
and have worked in teams of every size and across different countries.

I write technical specifications, requirements, design and product documentation, user stories and also code.

At the moment, I write back-end code in **Java** and front-end code in **TypeScript** using **React.js** library.
Have also worked on Python and Golang projects.
I also design HTTP based APIs and event driven APIs.

As a **DevOps** enthusiast, I develop applications that can be shipped easily and monitored thoroughly.

Being a thorough believer of **Open Source Software**, I contribute to open source projects,
and it's also the same reason for hosting my learnings in public through this website.
