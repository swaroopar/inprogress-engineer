Started my software engineering journey in 2009 and have been working in the software industry in various contexts and roles.
The focus has always been on learning domains and technologies as I come across them.

I'm a self-taught developer originally from India and currently living in Germany. Pushing code since 2015,
and have worked in teams of every size and across different countries.

At the moment, I write back-end code in **Java** and front-end code in **TypeScript** using (**React.js**) library.
I also design and implement REST APIs using OpenAPI specifications. Have worked on integration technologies
such as SOAP, REST, Kafka, JMS, etc.

As a **DevOps** enthusiast, I develop applications that can be containerized and
automate the complete **CI & CD** processes.

Being a thorough believer of **Open Source Software** , I contribute to open source projects,
and it's also the same reason for hosting my learnings in public through this website.
