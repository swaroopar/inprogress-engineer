To support and push EU's strong moves to secure its digital sovereignty with a common vision for 2030, there is a need for providing an open-source and ready-to-use cloud computing stack for CSPs to offer infrastructure services and also an open-source managed services framework to offer a competitive service catalog on top of it.
The intention of the Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) is to provide an open-source cloud computing stack ready to be utilized by cloud service providers as well as operators of private cloud environments and the Eclipse Xpanse project provides a framework to offer fully managed services on public and private clouds.
In this talk, we will see how SCS and Eclipse Xpanse makes a great combination to offer a fully open-source backed cloud stack.
