# Roots

We come across square roots and cube roots concept
where we need to find a number which when multiplied by itself certain number of times gives us the original number.

$\sqrt{9}$ is 3 because 3 \* 3 = 9.

:::important relation to square in geometry
Square roots give the length of the side of a square given its area.
This is exactly why it's called a **square** root.^

The word **root** here means, it will get us the fundamental measure of the geometric shape.

Similarly cube roots gives us the length of the side of a cube given its volume.

if x\*x = y, then $\sqrt{y}$ is x.
