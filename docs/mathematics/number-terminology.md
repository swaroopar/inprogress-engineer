# Number Terminology

<!-- vale Microsoft.Dashes = NO  -->

1. **Prime Numbers** - A number that can't be divided/grouped by any other number except 1 and itself.
   Examples are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc.
2. **Composite Numbers** - A number that can be divided by numbers other than 1 and itself.
   Examples are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, etc. **This is nothing but a product of prime numbers.**
3. **Factors** - Numbers that can be multiplied together to get another number.
   It means, the factors that result in the number.
   For example, the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6 because: 1 \* 6 = 6 and 2 \* 3 = 6
4. **Multiples** - Numbers that can be divided by a given number without leaving a remainder.
   For example, the multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, etc.
5. **Rational numbers** - Numbers that are ratio of whole numbers.
   For example, 1/2, 3/4, 5, –2, etc.
6. **Irrational numbers** - Numbers that can't be expressed as a ratio of two integers.
   Examples include $\sqrt{2}$, $\pi$, $e$.
7. **Real numbers** - All rational and irrational numbers combined.
8. **Imaginary numbers** - Numbers that involve the square root of a negative number, denoted by 'i' where $i^2$ = –1.
9. **Whole numbers** - All natural numbers including zero (0, 1, 2, 3, ...).
10. **Natural numbers** - Positive integers starting from 1 (1, 2, 3, ...).
    The trick is to remember that natural numbers are counting things naturally,
    meaning things that exist. Hence 0 isn't part of it.
11. **Integers** - All whole numbers and their negative counterparts (..., –3, –2, –1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...).
12. **Factorial** - The product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given number.
    For example, $n!$ = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

## Factors vs Multiples

- Factors divides number into groups of different sizes.
- Multiples are increasing groups by the same size at each step.

:::important prime factors vs regular factors
**Prime Factorization** is the process of expressing a composite number as the product of its prime factors.
For example, the prime factorization of 28 is 2 × 2 × 7.

Even if the factors are only big numbers, we will keep breaking them down until we reach prime numbers.

## Rational vs Irrational Numbers

It's best to understand this with examples and the method used to convert decimals to fractions.
It's clear that the **terminating decimals** are proper rational numbers.
But in the below examples, we see how any **repeating decimals** are also rational numbers.

:::danger irrational numbers can't be fractions
Irrational numbers are can never be represented as fractions of two integers.
They have non-terminating and non-repeating decimal expansions.

$$
\begin{aligned}
x &= 0.\overline{6} \\
10x &= 6.\overline{6} \\
10x - x &= 6.\overline{6} - 0.\overline{6} & \text{(subtract x from both sides. Value of x taken from first line.)}\\
9x &= 6 \\
x &= \frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
x &= 0.\overline{27} \\
100x &= 27.\overline{27} \\
100x - x &= 27.\overline{27} - 0.\overline{27} & \text{(subtract x from both sides. Value of x taken from first line.)} \\
99x &= 27 \\
x &= \frac{27}{99} = \frac{3}{11}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Square roots as middle point

When we build factor pairs for a number,
both sides of the factor pair will have one number greater than the square root and other number less than the square root.

:::tip square root tricks

- Any factor bigger than $\sqrt{N}$ will have its pair factor smaller than $\sqrt{N}$.
- If no number $\leq \sqrt{N}$ divides N, then nothing will and N is a prime number.
  :::

$$
\begin{aligned}
N = 36 \\
\sqrt{N} = 6 \\
\text{all factor pairs of 36.} \\
1 × 36 \\
2 × 18 \\
3 × 12 \\
4 × 9 \\
6 × 6 \\
\text{LHS increases and stops at } \sqrt{N} \\
\text{RHS decreases and stops at } \sqrt{N} \\
\end{aligned}
