# /usr directory

**/usr** directory in Linux doesn't stand for **user** but for **Unix System Resources**.

:::info symlinks to other folders
/bin, /lib and /sbin are just symlinks to /usr.

So /usr is the single directory that contains all libraries and binaries that comes with the operating system.

## Where it's used

The directory is used by all userspace applications and programs.

1. It's available for the systemd to use everything from here during the boot.
2. Also all installations from package managers such as apt, yum, dnf, etc goes here.

## Merged directories

Earlier, /bin, /lib and /sbin were separate directories,
but they have been merged into /usr.

Currently they're just symlinks to /usr.
