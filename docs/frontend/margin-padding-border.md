# Margin Vs Padding vs Border

Unfortunately this been one of my very confusing topics always. 
I look up the definition of these 3 parameters every often on internet. 

Margin - It is the space between two elements. It is the outside the element. 
Padding - it is the inside an HTML element. From content to border. 
Think of it as the extra "padding" provided to content to increase its space in the page.
Border - It is the fence of the element. It is the area around content + padding

:::important Margins Auto-Collapse
Both margin and padding helps to add space between elements. 
But margins between two vertical elements auto-collapse. 

This means, if two vertical elements having a margin of 1em, 
then the overall margin between these two elements will be 1em only.
