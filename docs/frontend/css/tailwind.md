# Tailwind CSS

## Responsive Design

TailwindCSS has mobile-first approach. Which means, the breakpoint what we sent in the CSS configuration is devices with
bigger size. Example, if we say `md:p-32` this means, the padding of size 32 will be added to all devices equal and above
the size of `md` breakpoint.

It's necessary to think in the opposite way. By default, write for smaller screens and add conditions only for
bigger screens.
