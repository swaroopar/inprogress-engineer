# Go Routines

Go routines are lightweight virtual threads which are created and managed by Golang.

:::important different to Java
In Java, every thread has an associated OS thread.

But in Golang, one OS thread is divided into multiple virtual threads called Goroutines.

It has an inbuilt scheduler which schedules the threads itself for queueing.
