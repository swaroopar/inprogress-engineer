# Smart Contracts

It's an Ethereum-based technology that allows developers to create decentralized applications on the blockchain.

These applications are deployed on all full nodes.
The transaction must mention which contract must be executed.
This is similar to a function name.
All nodes in the block chain must execute the same function with the same parameters.
When all have the same result, the transaction is considered valid and added to the block chain.
