# Weights

weights - they're the values that represent the strength of the connection between two nodes in a neural network.

bias - values held by the neuron in the neural network.

Parameters - Weights and biases together are called parameters of the model.

:::important adjusting weights and bias
During training, both weights and biases are adjusted to minimize the difference
between the predicted output and the actual output.
