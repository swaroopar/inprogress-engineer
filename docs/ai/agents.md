# Agentic AI

They're systems which takes a specific goal from the user and then
performs a series of actions to achieve that goal.

Reasoning -> Planning -> Execution

:::danger Agentic AI vs AI Agent
All agentic AI systems are AI agents, but not all AI agents are agentic AI systems.

AI agent can be any system that interacts with an LLM.
:::

Example - If we want to book a holiday, the agent will first reason about the
flight booking process, then plan the steps to book the flight and
then the hotels and then do them accordingly without any human intervention.
