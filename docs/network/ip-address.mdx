# IP Address

IP addresses are always virtual. It has nothing physical.
This is exactly why one single MAC address can have multiple IP addresses.

It's up to the software behind the network stack to handle packets for different IP addresses differently.

MAC is the only physical address and it's used in communication between devices.
Every communication between any two components in the network happens via MAC address.
