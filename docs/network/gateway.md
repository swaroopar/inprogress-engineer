# Gateways

Even though the name gateway makes it look special,
it's just another IP (need not be .1) of the subnet and
this IP is given to a router so that it can then connect this subnet to another subnets.

:::important mental model for gateways
The data link layer of a subnet is extended by making a router part of the network.

This is exactly why any broadcast messages reach the gateway interface as well.
