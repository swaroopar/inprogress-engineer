# ref

When a React component is mounted, it inserts the component as a new node to the DOM tree.

By using **ref** property, React will set reference to the underlying [node object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node)
which was rendered by React for that specific component.

We can run functions on that **node** object when necessary.
