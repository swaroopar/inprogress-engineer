# Hashing

Hashing is a process of converting data to any fixed size output called hash or digest.
Any small change in the input data results in a completely different output hash.

:::important One-way Only
Hashing is a **one-way** process.
We can't get the original data back from the hash.
:::

## Use cases

1. Digital signatures.
2. Storing passwords.
3. Verifying data integrity.
4. Data shortening - Eg., URL shortening.

## HMAC - Hash-based Message Authentication Code

HMAC is a specific type of hash that uses a secret key along with the data to produce a hash.
This ensures that only parties with the secret key can verify the integrity of the data.

:::tip Used for Authentication
Since the HMAC involves a secret key, it's used for authentication purposes.
