# Trusted Platform Module (TPM)

TPM is a chip on the motherboard that provides security functions.

It's important to keep in mind that TPM is just a tamper proof recorder.
Neither does TPM does any verification of the data that's written to it nor
the systems writing data to it does any verification.

:::tip **platform** in TPM
The word "platform" in TPM refers to the entire hardware and software that's running on the
computer on which the TPM is hosted.

It provides a way to secure everything that's running on that platform.

## Platform Configuration Register (PCR)

This is the volatile memory of the TPM.
The data here is written by each component of the platform during boot.
Each component in the boot chain, measures the next component that it's going to execute
and writes the hash of that measurement to a specific PCR slot.

:::danger Component doesn't measure itself
Each component measures the next component that it's going to execute.
:::

It basically represents the state of the platform at a given time.

:::important who writes to PCR?
The PCR is written to by the platform components, such as the BIOS, bootloader, and
operating system, BitLocker PIN, etc.

The standards are defined already on who writes to which block of PCR.
So every underlying part of the platform is aware of what and where it should write to PCR.
:::

Every part of the platform that writes to PCR, always calculates it's state and creates an **hash** of that state
and write to its PCR slot.
This means, any small change will change the hash and thus the PCR value.

## Extending Values

A specific PCR value of a slot is updated by multiple stages of the boot process.
Example, the operating system will extend the PCR value with the hash of the kernel,
and then the kernel will extend it with the hash of the initrd, systemd and many more.
This is done using the `TPM2_Extend` command, which appends the new hash to the existing PCR value.
This way, the PCR value is a cumulative hash of all the components that have been measured during the boot process.

:::warning Initial values of PCR indexes
Initial value of PCR is always 0x00.
This is set during the reboot of the system.
:::

## PCR Quotes and Attestation

PCR quotes is nothing but the current values of PCR values.
But the quote isn't returned as is.
It's signed using the Attestation Key (AK) of the TPM.
This signed quote can be used to verify the integrity of the platform.

:::tip Why Attestation Needed?
Attestation here is same as the real world attestation, where a trusted entity verifies the authenticity of a claim.

In this case, the TPM signs the PCR quote using private key and
the verifier can use the public key to verify the signature and
confirm that the PCR quote came from a trusted source.

This is similar to SSL. Here the CA is already known to the verifier.
:::

## Sealed Key

This is a feature that's used to protect sensitive data using TPM.
This is the feature used by BitLocker to encrypt the disk encryption key.

:::important Sealed Key Generation and Reading

Generation - Send key to be sealed -> Encrypt Key -> Attach PCR values -> Return Sealed Key
Reading - Send Sealed Key -> Decrypt Key -> Verify PCR values -> Return original key if PCR values match.

Here, the system asking for a sealed key must inform which PCR values must be used to seal the key.
This is nothing but the PCR policy.
