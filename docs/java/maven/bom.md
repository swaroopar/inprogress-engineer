# Build of Materials

BOM in maven is about adding version constraints for dependencies and transitive dependencies.
In a BOM file, we define an allowed version for each dependency.
By adding such a BOM dependency to **dependency-management**,
any **dependencies** clause doesn't need a version to be explicitly mentioned.
It will be automatically fetched from the versions defined in BOM.

The BOM itself will never bring in any dependencies.

:::important relation with hardware
In case of hardware, we've BOM which defines the list of allowed hardwar/components that can be used.
Additionally, BOM also refers to the list of hardware/components that were used in the end product.

In Maven and Gradle, BOM refers to the first concept.
The later concept is what we refer to SBOM in software deliveries.
