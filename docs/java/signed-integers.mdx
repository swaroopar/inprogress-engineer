# Signed Integers

In Java, integer of every size is signed.
This is exactly why the range of the type is reduced by one bit.
This one bit is used for holding the sign value.

:::tip remember size of each primitive type

1. byte - 8-bit signed
2. short - 16-bit signed
3. int - 32-bit signed
4. long - 64-bit signed

## Range of integers

For every integer type, the range is always $$-2^{N-1}$$ to $$2^{N-1} - 1$$.

:::warning Always one less on the positive side
It's very important to remember these limits.
This is happens because 0 is also considered on the positive side.
