# Introduction

These are considered as notes rather than documentation.
I write them as and when I come across and mostly give me ðŸ’¡ light bulb moments.

The focus is more on double-clicking on foundational details of topics and
the information is mostly taken from different sources available online and is
curated in the language that's as simple as possible.

The website is named **in-progress engineer** since I strongly believe that learning is a never ending process.
