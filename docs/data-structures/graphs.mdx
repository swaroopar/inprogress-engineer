# Graphs

1. Directed and Undirected - Means either one way or two way connection.
2. Cyclic and Acyclic - Meaning if the graph has cyclic relation between it's nodes.
3. Connected and Non-Connected Graph - Whether all nodes in the graph is reachable from other nodes of the graph.

:::important Graphs have no root
Unlike trees, graphs don't have any root node.
So in all problems, ideally any node can be treated as root or starting point in the graph.
