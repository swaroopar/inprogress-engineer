# Binary Tree

## Binary Tree Transversal

There are two ways to mainly do it.

1. Depth First Search (DFS) - Go as deep as possible in one branch before backtracking.
2. Breadth First Search (BFS) - Explore all nodes at the present depth level
   before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

:::warning processing and visiting a node
When we say processing a node, it means doing some operation on the node like printing its value.

When we say visiting a node, it means just going to that node without doing any operation on it.

### Depth First Search (DFS)

There are three ways to do DFS.

1. Pre-order Traversal - Visit the root, then the left sub-tree, and finally the right sub-tree.
2. In-order Traversal - Visit the left sub-tree, then the root, and finally the right sub-tree.
3. Post-order Traversal - Visit the left sub-tree, then the right sub-tree, and finally the root.

:::danger meaning of root
Here when we say root, it means the current node.
Every node is considered as a root of its own sub-tree.
It means, when we reach a node, we start considering that node as root of its own sub-tree.

**Knowing this small nuance then is very important to understand the traversal algorithms.**

:::important meaning of word order in names
Here the order in the names refer to the order in which the **root** of a node is processed.

- **Pre** means, root is processed first.
- **Post** means root is processed last.
- **In** means root is processed in between left and right sub-tree.

## Example Binary Tree Transversal

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["A"]
    B["B"]
    C["C"]
    D["D"]
    E["E"]
    F["F"]
    G["G"]
    H["H"]
    I["I"]
    J["J"]
    K["K"]
    L["L"]
    M["M"]

    A --> B
    A --> C
    B --> D
    B --> E
    C --> F
    C --> G
    D --> H
    D --> I
    E --> J
    E --> K
    G --> L
    G --> M
```

- Pre-order Traversal: A, B, D, H, I, E, J, K, C, F, G, L, M
- In-order Traversal: H, D, I, B, J, E, K, A, F, C, L, G, M
- Post-order Traversal: H, I, D, J, K, E, B, F, L, M, G, C, A

## Real life use cases

Just read these use cases to understand where binary trees are used in real life.
This will also help to understand what these different orders really mean.

### Preorder

- Directory structure listing.
  You visit a directory (root) first → then recursively print its subdirectories/files.
- Data serialization - You write the root node first → then recursively write left and right sub-trees.
  Used in JSON.

### Inorder

- Binary Search Trees (BST) traversal to get sorted order of elements.
  The output is always the sorted order of elements.
  This is by default necessary in case of databases.
- [Expression trees](./expression-trees).
  Ideally this is something that's usable in all 3 types of traversals.

### Postorder

- Deleting a directory tree - Children (files/subfolders) are deleted first → then the folder itself.
- Computing total resource usage / aggregations - You sum child nodes first → then assign parent’s total.
