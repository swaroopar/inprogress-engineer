# Hash Tables

Hash table is a data structure which has an array as it's underlying data structure.
This the **core** data structure and other languages implement it with other names.
Java for example has HashMap and HashSet as two different implementations of it
and Python has dict which is nothing but Java's HashMap.

:::tip why the name table
Because unlike a linked list or a tree, here since array is used,
it has a flat table like structure to store data.

:::danger Linked list in each index
We need linked list in each index to handle **collisions**.
Multiple keys leading to same hash and eventually to same index must be added to the same slot.
:::

## Implementation in Java

1. The key class's **hash()** method is used to get the index of the array where the key-value pair must be stored.
2. The HashMap has **Node[]** as it's underlying array.
3. This **Node** is nothing but an implementation of **Entry()** interface.
4. This Entry has - key, value, link to next Node/Entry object.
5. During **search(key)**, **hash()** method is used to get the index of the array where this **key** can be searched.
   Then loops through the **Entry** object stored in that index and
   uses the **equal()** method of the key's class to get the correct entry.

:::important length of linked list
If the size of the hash table isn't selected correctly,
then more keys get hashed to same index and this leads to increase of linked list size.
This degrades the performance because the search must through entire list
and **put()** must loop through entire list to figure the last entry in the linked list to add the new entry.

## HashSet()

This is exactly same as HashMap() but the only difference is that it doesn't hold any **values**.
The HashSet() simply uses a dummy value **PRESENT** as the value in all the **Entry()** object.
