# Volumes

Volumes refer to storage and there many types of volume available.
These types depends on where's the storage is coming from, lifecycle of the storage, location, etc.

We define the type of the of the volume in the [pod level volume](./pods.mdx#pod-information-in-manifests)
and it's corresponding details.

```yaml
volumes:
    - name: my-storage
      persistentVolumeClaim: # volume type
          claimName: my-pvc
```

:::danger Persistent Volume Claim is a Type
It's very confusing to me that PVC is a volume type.
When we compare with other names such as NFS, local, hostPath, etc., this name isn't intuitive.

We must look it as a volume type that **proxies** to the actual storage via a PV.
