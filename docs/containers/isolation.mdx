# Isolation in Containers

This is achieved by using [namespaces](../linux/namespaces).

:::info Not fully separated virtual machines
Even though Docker gives a feeling that containers are individual machines, it's not true.

It's just another process running with different set of namespaces.
:::

## Image Contents

The docker image contains it's own userspace rootfs filesystem.
Meaning it contains it's own /bin, /lib, /usr, /etc file systems
which are mounted into a new [mount namespace](mount-namespace.mdx).

## Prepare Namespaces

When a container is started, the docker binary first creates all necessary namespaces.
These new namespaces will be a copy of the parent process's corresponding namespaces.

Then it will start the **init** process which then updates the namespace content accordingly.

## clone() Method

Similar to **fork()** method of Linux, containers use the **clone()** method to start the process.
The application process mentioned in the Dockerfile is started using this method.

This method provides an option to specific which namespaces are required to be created for this new process.

:::important example of namespaces flags
When we pass **--network=host** to the docker command,
it will simply avoid creating network namespace.
:::

## kernel dependency

Since the containers doesn't have a kernel packaged inside,
it can work only with a host that has a kernel for which the container is prepared for.

:::tip own rootfs
Even though it has it's own rootfs,
all the system calls generated by the binaries in rootfs are handled by the host kernel.
