# Isolation in Containers

This is achieved by using [namespaces](../linux/namesapces).

:::info Not fully separated virtual machines
Even though Docker gives a feeling that applications are running on its individual machine, it's not true.

It's just another isolated environment to execute a process
since the docker image doesn't have the kernel packaged into it.
:::

## clone() Method

Similar to **fork()** method of Linux, containers use the **clone()** method to start the process.
The application process mentioned in the Dockerfile is started using this method.

This method provides an option to specific which namespaces are required to be created for this new process.

:::important example of namespaces flags
When we say **--network=host** to the docker command,
it will simply avoid creating network namespace.
:::

## kernel dependency

Since the containers doesn't have a kernel packaged inside,
it can work only with a host that has a kernel for which the container is prepared for.

:::tip own rootfs
Even though it has it's own rootfs,
all the system calls generated by the binaries in rootfs are handled by the host kernel.
